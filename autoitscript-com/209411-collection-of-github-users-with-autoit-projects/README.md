## Collection of GitHub users (with AutoIt projects)

Hi folks üëã ,

I know about several of us do have AutoIt projects on GitHub.<br>
In this hopefully growing collection I want to list forum members and their GitHub projects (AutoIt based).

**Why?**<br>
One use case could be the contribution to some of their projects.<br>
Assume that AutoIt projects are not that wide spreaded or supported in terms of contribution (participation), as JavaScript projects for example.

- Wouldn't it be nice to get more contribution on your project?
- Wouldn't it be nice to work on bigger projects in a community?

I personally would love to üòÄ .

**Disclaimer:**<br>
As the GitHub profiles (and repositories), I will list here, are public and your profiles either findable by your signature, your "About Me" page or<br>
by a simple Google or GitHub seach üîç , I see no restriction to collect these kind of information and post it here. In case you don't agree with this<br>
visualisation and you don't want to be listet here, please let me know and I will remove that entry as soon as possible ü§ù .<br>
I really hope that fits your feeling about it.

**Collection (in progress):**

I would love to see the list growing and I am very excited about a possibly upcoming behavior and improvement change, regarding AutoIt on GitHub üòä .<br>
üí° Please help me to increase the list. Either by your GitHub link (profile) or through a link from a member you know.

Best regards<br>
Sven

    Stay innovative!
